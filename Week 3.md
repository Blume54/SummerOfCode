# Week 3: Code Away :surfer:

This week we're getting serious with coding.

## Day 1: You have more Heroes :two_women_holding_hands:
List and style your heroes.
 - Before you start coding, run the app
 - [Create mock heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt2#create-mock-heroes)
   - Feel free to add your own heroes!
 - [Displaying heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt2#displaying-heroes)
   - Add missing code to heroes.component.ts, don't remove the existing
 - [List heroes with *ngFor](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt2#list-heroes-with-ngfor)
   - You should now see your heroes in the browser
 - [Style the heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt2#style-the-heroes)
   - Our file is called "heroes.component.scss"
   - Add the styles from [heroes.component.css](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt2#final-code-review)
 - Last but not least: Commit your changes

## Day 1: Git and Test
 - Open the Projects/heroes folder in Visual Studio Code
   - Open the Source Control tab
   - Note that many new files are listed
   - These were created by the "ng build" command we ran yesterday
 - Edit the file .gitignore
   - Add a new line at the end
     ```
     /dist
     ```

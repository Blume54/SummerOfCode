If you can't remember how to do something we already did, look it up in [last week's curriculum](https://github.com/phaze9/SummerOfCode/blob/master/Week%201.md)!

## Day 1: Git and Test :hotsprings:
Work with Git(Hub) and fix the tests.
 - Open the Projects/heroes folder in Visual Studio Code
   - Open the Source Control tab
   - Note that many new files are listed
   - These were created by the "ng build" command we ran yesterday
 - Edit the file .gitignore
   - Add a new line at the end
     ```
     /dist
     ```
   - And save the file using Cmd/Ctrl-S
   - Now you should only have one outgoing change, the file .gitignore
 - Click Synchronize Changes :doughnut: in the blue bar on the bottom left of Visual Studio
   - Open your heroes repository on the GitHub website
   - Notice how all your changes from yesterday  are visible there
 - Go back to the Source Control tab in Visual Studio
   - Enter a commit message: Updated .gitignore
   - Add the file .gitignore :heavy_plus_sign:
   - And commit  
 - Yesterday you might have noticed that some tests we ran in the Terminal failed
   - We broke these when we changed the application two days ago
   - Let's fix them!
 - Open a Terminal and change to the ~/Projects/heroes folder
   - Then run
     ```
     ng test
     ```
   - One test succeeded, two failed
 - AppComponent > should have as title 'heroes'
   - Open the file app.component.spec.ts in Visual Studio
   - Change line 22 until the test succeeds
     - The test is rerun automatically when you save the file
   - Look at the [changes we did at the end of day 6](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt0#change-the-application-title) to get an idea what you need to fix 
 - AppComponent > should render title
   - Change line 29 in the same file to
     ```
     expect(compiled.querySelector('h1').textContent).toContain('Tour of Heroes');  
     ```
 - Don't forget to commit and synchronize your changes
   - Use the message: Fixed the tests
 
## Day 2: Run the application :running:
Run your heroes app manually and automatically.
 - Open a Terminal and change to the ~/Projects/heroes folder
 - Run the heroes app using
   ```
   ng serve --open
   ```
   - This will start a server hosting your app and open a browser to http://localhost:4200
 - Now open the heroes folder in Visual Studio Code
 - Change the color of the title to your favorite color
   - Edit the file src/styles.scss
   - Change the color of the 'h1' element to one of the following
     ![CSS Color Names](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*IUKKnAi_7ZjM91Fouh2yxA.png)
 - Commit and synchronize your change 
   - Briefly describe what you did in the commit message
 - We can also run our app automatically to test it
   - Stop the app by pressing Ctrl-C in the Terminal window
   - Yesterday we ran the unit tests
   - Today we will run the e2e (end-to-end) tests
     ```
     ng e2e
     ```
 - As with the unit tests we also broke an e2e test with our changes three days ago
   ```
   1) workspace-project App should display welcome message
   - Failed: No element found using locator: By(css selector, app-root .content span)
   ```
 - Fix the failing test
   - In app.po.ts we need to change where the title is read from in line 9
     - Replace
       ```
       by.css('app-root .content span')
       ```
     - With
       ```
       by.css('h1')
       ```
   - Find out what to change in e2e/src/app.e2e-spec.ts
     - Hint: The fix is similar to what we did yesterday
   - Rerun the e2e tests to verify  
   - Again: Commit and synchronize your change
 - Head over to your heroes repository on GitHub
   - Invite your tutor as a collaborator so they can review your work
